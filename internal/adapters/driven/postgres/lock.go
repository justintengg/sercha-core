// - Advisory locks are connection-scoped, not TTL-based
// - If the connection is lost, the lock is automatically released
// - TTL parameter is ignored (locks don't expire automatically)
// - Extend is a no-op since locks don't have TTL
//
// For production multi-worker deployments, Redis locks are recommended.
// This is provided as a fallback when Redis is unavailable.
